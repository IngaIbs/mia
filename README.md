# MIA

## Getting Started

First install the dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Then move the sample data files to a new folder called `data` and run the individual steps of the `install.ipynb` notebook. Some of the steps might take some time. Afterwards the data is available in the SQLite database in `db/sql.db`. You can inspect it using for example [`sqlitebrowser`](http://sqlitebrowser.org/). Check the `sql_examples.ipynb` afterwards.
